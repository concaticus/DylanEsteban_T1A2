<!-- published site-->


Purpose: the intent and purpose behind this website was to build functional site, utilising working knowledge of HTML, CSS, Git and GitHub, in order to design an online presence for myself as a future developer. Further more, this site will be worked on, improved, and returned too over again in order to also serve as a repository for completed future projects. My hope is that this will also illustrate my passions, interests, but importantly, my tech related work and skills.

Functionality: 
- Balsamiq was employed for mock-up design and wireframe implementation.
- This site includes a home page, an about-me page, a blog, a page for contact, as well as a page for future project displays

- A responsive home page with a few transition effects and animations which immediately seek to introduce the viewer to my site as well as an indication of my identity, passions, and aspirations 
- A responsive home page, replete with transition effects which capture the attention of the viewer as well as provide a more UI friendly experience, as well as an immediately down-loadable link to CV. Care was taken to utilise target attribute to ensure viewer remains on website and can download VC directly.
- A responsive and integrated navbar is provided which features links to professional (GitHub, LinkedIn) and Social Media based accounts (Twitter, Instagram).
- Navbar includes links and buttons to all accessible pages as well as a means to return home via the home-button
- A dedicated projects page was built to house future projects as well as a blog page is provided for future entries
- Where appropriate, comments have been added in with the HTML and CSS files to identify different componants or styling decisions. This also seeks to aid in readability.
- Care was taken to ensure a responsive web experience for mobile, table, and desktop users. Naturally, some difficulties and issues were encountered, especially in regards to mobile design and and the implementation of media queries. Considerations for accessibility as well has been looked at, though some challenges were also met in this regard with implementation. These concerns and defects are intended to be further improved upon and addressed in future post-assignment submission. Short-comings are inevitable; I intend to use this experience as an opportunity to learn from these mistakes and improve these areas in future.



Target Audience: firstly, for myself, to demonstrate the quality of work I know I am capable of producing. Secondly, my target audience are my teachers, potential employers, and recruiters. This modest effort is the first step - I am hopeful - in the right direction and will serve as an indication of where I originally was today and the many destinations that lie ahead. 

Tech stack:
